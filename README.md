# Project done for CASA_CV: Face_clustering
Team Members: Giordano Lucio, Sellitto Giulia, D'alessandro Carmine, Lishchynska Ruslana

##Project overview:
From a dataset of videos of 62 different people walking in different contexts, we had to cluster their faces to create a facial recognition system.
The dataset has 3 folders of those people walking watching the camera and 3 folders of people trying to avoid it and 1 folder where people are filmed with the camera moving around their faces while they are not moving.
The dataset is private, so in this repository it isn't present.
Further information are provided as comments at the beginning of each code script.

##Repository:
The repository contains 4 main folders:
###dataset
Contains mock files describing the dataset structure. The actual dataset is not present on this repository for a matter of privacy.
###different_feature_extraction
Contains scripts in which is also explained how the two different feature extractors used in the project work.
###csv_files
Contains various csv files generated either for the training process and for the testing process and also contains the results of the first method.
###scripts
Contains the scripts used in the project.
